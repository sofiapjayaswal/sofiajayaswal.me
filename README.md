For my website, I created three different html files, index.html, about.html, and interest.html. All of thes html files share the same style sheet, style.css. 
There are shared elements in each of these html files, such as the background, navigation, logo and the links to my LinkedIn and email on the bottom. In index.html, 
I just had a intro and a link to email me. In about, I included a picture of myself as well as fun facts about me. For the interests page, I wanted to make it more 
interactive, so I used the hover function on the classes that included the images and the text.
