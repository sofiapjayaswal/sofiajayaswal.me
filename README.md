For my website, I created three different html files, index.html, about.html, and interest.html. All of these html files share the same style sheet, style.css. The code for the home page is within index.html. The code for the about page is within about.html. And lastly, the code for the interest page is within interest.html. There are shared elements in each of these html files, such as the background, navigation, logo and the links to my LinkedIn and email on the bottom. In index.html, I just had a intro and a link to email me. In about, I included a picture of myself as well as fun facts about me. For the interests page, I wanted to make it more interactive, so I used the hover function on the classes that included the images and the text. In my style sheet, I styled my elements based on their classes or element type. Visit sofiajayaswal.me to see the website!
